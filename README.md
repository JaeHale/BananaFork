  [Reupload of an old project] Banana Fork is a three part text-based adventure series written in C++.
</p></b>

### Background

<p align="left">
  "Welcome to the game. You will have to make choices or something." These 12 words, shown everytime you boot into a new chapter of Banana Fork, show you just how much of a treat you are in for. With crazy plots and characters, an overarching secret storyline, and a main character that can't seem to keep themselves out of trouble, Banana Fork is truly a text-based treat. Happy playing!
